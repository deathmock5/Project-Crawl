I was talking to geig after class thursday and one question he asked me is if we have a general scope in mind. With the style of overworld map we plan on using I was thinking 2-3 smaller duneons then 1 big dunegon (kinda like the castle vs normal stage in super mario world) with a boss at the end of the bigger dungeons. I think then 4-5 worlds(2-3 smaller dungeons and 1 big dungeon per "world") That way we could make the area and dungeon mirror a theme of the general area like the first being your basic gravel and stone dungeon then having an ice world, fire, ect... just wanted to know if we have a scope in mind yet and what you guys think of that general layout for the gameworld.

I also plan to work on a powerpoint for a pitch with some basic drawn visuals to help us succede.

thank you

i was thinking about 10 normal dungions, with only a texture swap between them.
at the end of each dungion is a boss.

That works for me I was trying to get a general idea in my head of how to go about trying to graph or draw out some basic level design when we get to that stage.
