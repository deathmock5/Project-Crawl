	Not sure how serious the story is supposed to be. Figured a couple of general outlines. Could choose one or more. Read them over if you get a chance and we can discuss Tues. The player character has not been named so I'm using [PC] as a placeholder.


	Start [PC] as a soldier that just graduated basic training, and his first mission is the tutorial mission. The squad gets wiped out and [PC] goes through several dungeons trying to get home (multiplayer could be other surviving members).
Jeremy votes for this one, generic soldier sprites SHOULD be easy to find, could have zombie enemies from squad, etc. Easy from a story-writing POV 'cause there need only be a twist or two.


	Start [PC] in jail for having kicked the mayor's chicken (Fable reference), the mayor's daughter lost her teddy bear and to become free you have to retreive it (intro dungeon)...
Could have several video game references in the level and boss designs (walking down a road and get attacked by "angry birds", a portal in a dungeon transports you to a portal-esqu testing lab, etc), but would be more demanding of Sprite guy (a.k.a. Jeremy) as generic sprites would not be as acceptable.


	Start [PC] in town, was found unconscious and has amnesia. Townfolk took him in (blah blah blah generic discovering past storyline here).



	Feel free to put story ideas here.
